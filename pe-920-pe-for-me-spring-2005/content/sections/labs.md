| Week # | Topics | Lab Topics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What is Exercise? | Lab - Tour of DAPER facilities as "incoming research/design collective"  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Seminar - Microsoft® PowerPoint® presentation on the history of exercise in Western civilization |
| 2 | The Physical Intelligence Model | Lab - Tooling: Using Theraband, students build machines designed to exercise key aspects of physical intelligence (e.g., the body's relation to gravity, whole body movement, the role of sense perception)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Seminar - Survey of exercise machines/devices past and present |
| 3 | Visual and Kinesthetic Perception | Lab - Subjective and Objective Experiences of the Body: Walking running, leaping, while blindfolded yields dramatic physical experiences  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Seminar - Review of preliminary project proposals: concept drawings of three exercise machines/devices designed to cultivate physical intelligence |
| 4 | Physical Thinking | Lab - Thinking through the body for engineering insights: exploring our precognitive understanding of physical principles/properties (e.g., torsion, tension, weight, etc.)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Seminar - Brainstorming session on project sketch prototypes |
| 5 | Orientation Strategies: Balancing | Lab - Olympic Stumbling Competition: Playing the line between the maintenance and loss of balance as captured by high-speed video system. Best "compensatory dance" wins  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Seminar - The motor system at work: strategies for balance; review of student prototypes |
| 6 | Learning Movement | Lab - Exploring unexplored movement: increasingly complex/unusual movements reveal the highly evolved process of feedback involved in physical learning  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Seminar - Peer review of class projects with prepared questionnaire |
